The Python implementation of $ARGUMENTS is complete. Mirror it to TypeScript.

1. If the file .claude/skills/dual-sdk-parity.md exists, read it first.
2. Read typescript/CLAUDE.md for TypeScript conventions.
3. Read the Python source in python/src/trailproof/ for the $ARGUMENTS module.
4. Implement the TypeScript mirror in typescript/src/ following these parity rules:
   - Same public API (snake_case fields on wire types, camelCase methods)
   - Same behavior and edge case handling
   - Same error types
   - Must pass shared test vectors in fixtures/
5. Run `npm run all` in typescript/.
6. Report:
   - What was implemented
   - Any parity issues found
   - Type translation decisions made (e.g., Python dict -> TypeScript Record)
   - Test results

Do not touch Python files. Do not modify package.json without reporting it.
