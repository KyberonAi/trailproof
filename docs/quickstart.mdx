# Quickstart

Get up and running with Trailproof in 5 minutes. You'll install the library, emit events, query them, and verify the chain is intact.

## Installation

**Python**

```bash
pip install trailproof
# or
uv add trailproof
```

**TypeScript / Node.js**

```bash
npm install @kyberonai/trailproof
```

## 1. Create a Trailproof Instance

By default, Trailproof uses an in-memory store -- perfect for getting started.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from trailproof import Trailproof

tp = Trailproof()
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Trailproof } from "@kyberonai/trailproof";

const tp = new Trailproof();
```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Emit Events

Every event needs an `event_type`, `actor_id`, `tenant_id`, and `payload`. Trailproof auto-generates `event_id`, `timestamp`, and the hash chain fields.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
event = tp.emit(
    event_type="myapp.user.login",
    actor_id="user-42",
    tenant_id="acme-corp",
    payload={"ip": "1.2.3.4", "method": "oauth"},
)

print(event.event_id)    # UUID v4
print(event.hash)        # SHA-256 hash
print(event.prev_hash)   # "0" * 64 (genesis)
```

```typescript TypeScript
const event = tp.emit({
  eventType: "myapp.user.login",
  actorId: "user-42",
  tenantId: "acme-corp",
  payload: { ip: "1.2.3.4", method: "oauth" },
});

console.log(event.eventId);   // UUID v4
console.log(event.hash);      // SHA-256 hash
console.log(event.prevHash);  // "0".repeat(64) (genesis)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The first event in the chain uses a genesis hash of 64 zeros as its `prev_hash`. Every subsequent event links to the hash of the previous event.
</Note>

## 3. Query Events

Filter events by type, actor, tenant, time range, or any combination. Results are paginated with cursor-based navigation.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
result = tp.query(actor_id="user-42", limit=50)

for event in result.events:
    print(f"{event.event_type} at {event.timestamp}")

# Paginate
if result.next_cursor:
    next_page = tp.query(actor_id="user-42", cursor=result.next_cursor)
```

```typescript TypeScript
const result = tp.query({ actorId: "user-42", limit: 50 });

for (const event of result.events) {
  console.log(`${event.eventType} at ${event.timestamp}`);
}

// Paginate
if (result.nextCursor) {
  const nextPage = tp.query({ actorId: "user-42", cursor: result.nextCursor });
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## 4. Verify Chain Integrity

Walk the entire hash chain to confirm no events have been tampered with.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
verification = tp.verify()

print(verification.intact)  # True
print(verification.total)   # number of events
print(verification.broken)  # [] (empty = no tampering)
```

```typescript TypeScript
const verification = tp.verify();

console.log(verification.intact);  // true
console.log(verification.total);   // number of events
console.log(verification.broken);  // [] (empty = no tampering)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
If a tampered event is detected, `broken` contains the indices of all affected events. Because each event depends on the previous hash, tampering event N causes events N through the end to appear broken.
</Warning>

## 5. Persist to Disk

Switch to the JSONL file store for events that survive restarts.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
tp = Trailproof(store="jsonl", path="events.jsonl")

# Events are appended to the file as JSON lines
event = tp.emit(
    event_type="myapp.user.login",
    actor_id="user-42",
    tenant_id="acme-corp",
    payload={"ip": "1.2.3.4"},
)

# Ensure all data is flushed to disk
tp.flush()
```

```typescript TypeScript
const tp = new Trailproof({ store: "jsonl", path: "events.jsonl" });

const event = tp.emit({
  eventType: "myapp.user.login",
  actorId: "user-42",
  tenantId: "acme-corp",
  payload: { ip: "1.2.3.4" },
});

tp.flush();
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
The JSONL file is human-readable. Inspect it with `cat events.jsonl | jq .` or `grep "user-42" events.jsonl`.
