<Warning>
**Early Release (v0.1.x)** — Trailproof is under active development. The core API is functional and tested, but interfaces may change between minor versions. Pin your dependency to a specific version in production.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Trailproof** = *Trail* + *Proof*. Every event is cryptographically chained — tamper one, and the entire chain proves it.
</Note>

## The Problem: Unprovable Audit Logs

Every system writes logs. But logs can be silently modified or deleted after the fact. There's no built-in way to prove an event log hasn't been tampered with.

| Capability | Basic Logging | **Trailproof** |
|---|---|---|
| **Tamper detection** | None — anyone with DB access can edit | SHA-256 hash chain; modify one event, every subsequent hash breaks |
| **Cross-SDK parity** | Manual effort to keep in sync | Python + TypeScript produce identical hashes for same data |
| **Dependencies** | Often pulls in heavy ORMs or cloud SDKs | Zero runtime deps — stdlib only |
| **Provenance** | No proof of origin | Optional HMAC-SHA256 proves who created the event |
| **Multi-tenancy** | Manual tenant isolation | Built-in `tenant_id` on every event |
| **Verification** | Manual spot-checks | `tp.verify()` walks entire chain in one call |

## The Trailproof Pipeline

Every event flows through a validation, hashing, optional signing, and append-only storage pipeline. Verification walks the chain backwards to check integrity.

## Core Pillars

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Tamper-Evident Chain" icon="link" color="#1E40AF">
    SHA-256 hash chain links every event to the previous one. Modify event 5 in a chain of 100 — events 5 through 100 all fail verification. You can't silently tamper with history.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dual SDK Parity" icon="code" color="#1E3A8A">
    Native libraries for Python and TypeScript with identical behavior. Same canonical JSON algorithm, same genesis hash, same test vectors. Emit in Python, verify in TypeScript.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Zero Dependencies" icon="feather" color="#3B82F6">
    Stdlib-only in Python (`hashlib`, `json`, `uuid`), Node.js built-ins only in TypeScript (`crypto`, `fs`). No supply chain risk from your audit trail.
  </Card>
  <Card title="HMAC Signing" icon="key" color="#1E40AF">
    Optional HMAC-SHA256 signatures prove event provenance — that events were created by the holder of a specific secret key. Uses timing-safe comparison to prevent timing attacks.

## Quick Example

```python
from trailproof import Trailproof

tp = Trailproof()

# Record an event
event = tp.emit(
    event_type="myapp.user.login",
    actor_id="user-42",
    tenant_id="acme-corp",
    payload={"ip": "1.2.3.4", "method": "oauth"},
)

# Verify the entire chain is intact
result = tp.verify()
print(result.intact)  # True
```

```typescript
import { Trailproof } from "@kyberonai/trailproof";

const tp = new Trailproof();

const event = tp.emit({
  eventType: "myapp.user.login",
  actorId: "user-42",
  tenantId: "acme-corp",
  payload: { ip: "1.2.3.4", method: "oauth" },
});

const result = tp.verify();
console.log(result.intact); // true
```

## The 10-Field Event Envelope

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `event_id` | string | UUID v4, auto-generated |
| `event_type` | string | Namespaced type (e.g., `myapp.user.login`) |
| `timestamp` | string | ISO-8601 UTC, auto-generated |
| `actor_id` | string | Who performed the action |
| `tenant_id` | string | Tenant/org isolation key |
| `trace_id` | string? | Cross-system correlation |
| `session_id` | string? | Session grouping |
| `payload` | object | Domain-specific data (opaque to Trailproof) |
| `prev_hash` | string | Hash of the previous event |
| `hash` | string | SHA-256 of this event |
| `signature` | string? | HMAC-SHA256 if signer configured |
